**Short GitHub Description:**  An interactive cycling game that integrates a real bicycle as a controller using sensors and actuators, promoting physical fitness through immersive gameplay. This project bridges the gap between exercise and gaming for a healthier, more engaging experience.

ABSTRACT:  This project explores the integration of physical exercise with interactive gaming through the development of a novel game controlled real-time using a real bicycle. Itâ€™s hard to get motivated to do something so insanely boring. But many can play immersive computer games for hours without getting bored.

Most of the kids spend too much time on video games without involving in any other physical games like football, cricket, etc. Since video games are now irreplaceable among the present generation, bringing physical activity to it is important for preserving the health of our coming generations. The primary objective is to enhance the gaming experience by incorporating a dynamic, physically engaging control mechanism that promotes fitness. The system consists of a custom-designed bicycle equipped with sensors and actuators to detect user movements and translate them into game controls. The game environment is designed to respond to these movements, creating an immersive experience that combines physical activity with digital gameplay. This project aims to address the growing need for innovative solutions that combine entertainment with exercise, fostering a more active lifestyle while enhancing the enjoyment and engagement of gaming. By bridging the gap between physical activity and interactive entertainment, this project seeks to set a new precedent in both fitness and gaming industries.
